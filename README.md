# Data Science project - *Elements of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science*

We scripted our python code in a Jupyter Notebook, therefore, when opened, it will be displaying all the graphs and images needed, which means there's no need to run the code.

A brief PowerPoint presentation in PDF format can be found, where we also display the discussion of our experiences and results.
